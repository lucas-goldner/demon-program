### Demon Program
This project is my way to get into more complex ReactJS coding. This website is going to allow you
summon your own demons from the Shin Megami Tensei franchiseÂ©. Source code is provided by Nakajima-san.
You will be allowed to summon 5 demons per day. Each demon will have its own random attributes, which will
be saved to your account. You can also fuse your demons to get stronger ones! Battling with an real opponent
or an AI will also be an option later down the line.

### Tech behind it
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). It is
going to utilize the Firebase Firestore Database in order to save all your precious demons and achievments.
Authorizing will also work with Firebase. Might add Twitter/Facebook/Google Login later but that is only
going to be the case if everything before it works flawlessly.
